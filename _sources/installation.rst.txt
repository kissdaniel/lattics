Installation
============

To use LattiCS, you'll need a Python interpreter. If you don't have one installed on your system, follow the instructions provided `here <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>`_.

We recommend using LattiCS in a separate virtual environment to avoid potential issues caused by conflicting package versions.

**For Linux users**

First, create a new virtual environment. If you haven't created one before, start by making an empty directory.

.. code-block::

    $ mkdir ~/.venvs
    $ python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/latticsenv

Activate the environment.

.. code-block::

    $ source ~/.venvs/latticsenv/bin/activate

**For Windows users**

First, create a new virtual environment using the Command Prompt. The environment folder will be created in your current working directory.

.. code-block::

    $ python -m venv latticsenv

Activate the environment.

.. code-block::

    $ latticsenv\Scripts\activate.bat

Next, install the LattiCS package from the Git repository.

.. code-block::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/kissdaniel/lattics.git

Start a Python shell and verify that the package can be successfully imported.

.. code-block::

    $ python
    >>> import lattics

If no error messages appear, the installation was successful.
