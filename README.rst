LattiCS (Lattice-based Cellular Simulator) is a flexible agent-based simulation framework designed to help you model the collective behavior of cellular systems and to support experimental biology.

Features
--------

* **Simple.** Customize key biological properties of individual cell agents, including cell cycle dynamics, cell-cell adhesion, motility, and phenotype changes. Simulate the transport of nutrients or drugs and their effects on cells. Define custom events during the simulation, such as treatments.
* **Ready-to-use.** Launch virtual experiments with minimal coding, using built-in tools tailored for common tasks.
* **Accessible.** Build your own models in Python without needing expert-level programming knowledge.

Installation
------------

You can install LattiCS directly from this repository using pip. See details `HERE <https://kissdaniel.github.io/lattics/installation.html/>`__
